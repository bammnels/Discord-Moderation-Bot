# Hello everyone!

I made this "basic" moderation bot on Python for Discord.

# What the bot can do?

1. Ban/Unban. (Optional: You can give a reason for ban).

2. Kick. (Optional: You can give a reason for kick).

3. Mute/Unmute. (Optional: You can give a reason for mute).

4. Userinfo.

5. Get the avatar of an user (except if it is an animated avatar).

(You can always use y!help for more information).

# Important

This bot have the MIT License. Also, this was made with Python 3.6.8 and you can download any version of Python here: https://www.python.org/. The bot's prefix is y!, but you can change it anytime.

# Thank you, and hope this can help you somehow!
